## Infinite NLP

Infinite Jest is a monster of a book. I have spent more time with it than any other book I've ever read and it's the only "big" book that I reread, still unsure if that was a good idea. I really like the book, but the more I've read and the more I learn about/listen to people talk about Wallace, the more hesitant I am to say it's my favorite book. I figure something that will be interesting and probably not make me feel any more clarity about whether or not it is my favorite book is to do as much natural language processing on the text as I can. I'm thinking of starting with seeing if there is enough diferentiation in the writing for third person chapters, first person chapters, and the footnotes to be identifiable as different narrators (who the narrator is, and if there is one or two or three narrators is a big question in IJ circles I've been involved in). I also want to try to see if Wallace's writting style has influence/connection to contemporary incel culture - something I have been more and more concerned about since my first read.

4chan pol board and maybe some other places for "negative" type posting/conversation that Wallace may have influence on

## Cancer image analysis

The following dataset has cancer imaging data, I want to make a CNN and potentially other classification models that can properly categorizes sarcomas based on the training sample. Will also look for other sarcoma datasets and publically available imaging data of lesions.

## Architectural classification

Start with kaggle set, work with my dad's imaging data and possibly also webscrapped images of different architectural styles. Focus on exteriors, might get into interiors
